              <span class="name">Studio Nanadashii</span> is a
              <span>devising theater group</span> based in Seoul, Korea. We
              explore a journey of life in search of the “real me” that exists
              between the “me I think of” (na, meaning ‘me’ in Korean) and the
              “me that emerges through creation” (na dashi, meaning ‘me again’
              in Korean).
            </p>
            <p>
              Led by director Yena Kim, who trained in Erzählkunst (meaning ‘Art
              of storytelling’ in German) in Germany, Studio Nanadashii has
              developed our own <span>“Iyagi-Kunst”</span> method (Iyagikkun,
              meaning ‘storyteller’ in Korean + Kunst, meaning ‘art’ in German),
              through which we extensively explore the performative layers of
              storytelling.
            </p>
            <p>
              We have broadened our audience through stage adaptations of
              classical literature, road theater, theater for young audiences,
              and barrier-free performances.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our family play, The Umbrella Thief, gained recognition at the
              2020 Seoul ASSITEJ Children's Theater Awards, winning a triple
              crown with the Grand Prize, Directing Award, and Audience Award.

                <p>
                  Adapted from the story "The Umbrella Thief" by Sri Lankan
                  author Sybil Wettasinghe, this work tells the tale of
                  Kirimama, who lives in a village without umbrellas and goes to
                  the city to buy an umbrella. As Kirimama repeatedly loses
                  her/his umbrella, (s)he undergoes changes, leading her/him to
                  question what is truly important not to lose. With animative
                  movements, mime, and playful wordplay, this warm story feels
                  like watching a cartoon.

                <p>
                  This performance, developed as part of the National Theatre
                  Company's Theatre for Early Years creative research workshop,
                  is designed for infants aged 36 months and under. It begins
                  with the question: If we were to condense the Earth’s 4.6
                  billion-year history into one year, what would spring, summer,
                  autumn, and winter look like? Over the course of 30 minutes,
                  the performance revisits the history of the Earth. What can
                  babies tell us about the mysteries of the universe? Welcoming
                  newly born infants, as well as adults who are equally newly
                  born in the context of the Earth's history, this performance
                  aims to create an intellectual playground for babies and their
                  families.

                  Set in a modern small studio apartment, this performance
                  unfolds the tales of love, war, and adventure as six celestial
                  beings descend from the white jade palace of heaven to the

                  novel "Okrumong", it features six actors who use their bodies
                  and diverse everyday objects to portray over dozens of
                  characters, bringing the story to life.

                  This immersive lecture performance shares the process of
                  exploring "the poverty of artists" with the audience. Using
                  the Russian novel, poetry, and essays of the same name as
                  source texts, it artistically explores a philosophical
                  discourse on poverty using documentary materials. Through
                  games and discussions with the audience, it encourages
                  reflections on the concept and definitions of poverty, the
                  criteria for wealth in contemporary society.
